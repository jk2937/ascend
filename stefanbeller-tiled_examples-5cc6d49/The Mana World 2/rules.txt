# tutorials:

# 1) introduction about versioning
#	explain that this tutorial is about the new stuff probably coming in 0.9
# 2) introduction to new automapping
#   - explain about not needing the set layer, but maybe able to use it
#   - explain about new regions concept


# 1) easy automapping (supportive collision tiles)
#       explain the need for collision tiles
#		explain regions layer, rule region, output region
# 

# 2) multiple inputs (stone or sign)
#       explain the possibility of multiple inputs ( mind bigger sizes )

# 3) random output (maybe with flowers)  rule_001.tmx
#		rely on multiple inputs

# 4) extended random output (flowers are not walkable) rule_001.tmx
#	explain the possibilites of automapping_delete and automapping_radius


# 5) water start 
#    showing the rulenot features

# 6) advanced features (water construction)
#   relying on already mapped output
#   checking for errors
